# BabysitterKata1
Project name is a a tool that allows babysitters to calculate a nightly pay of babysitting.

Babysitters have set rates for different hours for different families. This tool makes it easy to calculate hours and different dollar amounts.

- The babysitter:
Starts no earlier than 5:00PM
Leaves no later than 4:00AM
Only babysits for one family per night
Gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)
Should be prevented from mistakes when entering times (e.g. end time before start time, or outside of allowable work hours).

The job:

Pays different rates for each family (based on bedtimes, kids and pets, etc...)
Family A pays $15 per hour before 11pm, and $20 per hour the rest of the night
Family B pays $12 per hour before 10pm, $8 between 10 and 12, and $16 the rest of the night
Family C pays $21 per hour before 9pm, then $15 the rest of the night
The time ranges are the same as the babysitter (5pm through 4am)
Deliverable:

Calculate total pay, based on babysitter start and end time, and a family.
